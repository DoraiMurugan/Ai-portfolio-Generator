✨ Project Concepts
We are exploring several unique concepts for portfolio development. Our goal is to move beyond traditional resumes and create a memorable personal brand.

1. The Minimalist One-Pager 📄
A sleek, single-page web portfolio that highlights only the most essential information.

Core Elements: A powerful headline, a signature project, and clear contact details.

Goal: Simplicity and immediate impact.

2. The Interactive Resume 💼
An engaging portfolio that turns a resume into an interactive experience.

Features: Embed an interactive timeline with clickable milestones or projects. Each element reveals more details upon interaction.

Goal: To showcase history and achievements in a non-linear, engaging way.

3. The Social Thread Portfolio 🔗
A modern approach that leverages social proof and existing content.

Concept: Pin a curated thread of your work from platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub. Each post in the thread uses concise captions to describe a project or skill.

Goal: To create a living portfolio that is easy to update and share.

🛠️ Technical Models & Architecture
We are considering three distinct technical models to bring these concepts to life.

Model 1: The Vanilla Stack 🍦
A fundamental web development approach using core technologies.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: JavaScript

Data: Using a sheet (e.g., Google Sheets, CSV) for simple frontend and backend data management.

Model 2: The Full-Stack JS Approach 🌐
A robust structure for building modern web applications.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Backend: Node.js for server-side logic, APIs, and processing.

Model 3: The AI-Powered Model 🤖
An advanced concept to build an interactive AI chatbot that can act as a personal representative.

Technology: Python and AI/ML libraries.

Functionality: The chatbot will interact with users, trained on a .csv file containing professional data, skills, and project information
